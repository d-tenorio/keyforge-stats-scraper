To use keyforge_stats_scraper_exe, make sure the file kf_deck_links consists of keyforge-compendium links, 
one per line with no extra spaces or characters added. The sample file shows a properly formatted example.

Then, double click on the executable file. If the program executes successfully, the output should be saved to a
file named 'deck_info_output.txt'.
